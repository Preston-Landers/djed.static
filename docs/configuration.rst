Configuration
=============

You can configure djed.static via your ini-file:

.. code-block:: ini

    [app:myapp]
    djed.static.components_name = lib
    ...

To understand the ini-setting options, let's take a look at the URL structure
that is generated by BowerStatic:

.. code-block:: bash

    /bowerstatic/components/jquery/2.1.1/dist/jquery.js

The setting options allow you to change the first part of all your
components URLs and configure the second part for the default component URL:

``djed.static.publisher_signature``
    The first part of all components URLs.

    default: ``bowerstatic``

``djed.static.components_name``
    The second part of the default component URL.

    default: ``components``
